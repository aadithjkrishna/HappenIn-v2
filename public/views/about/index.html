    We are a team of passionate Computer Science students — Devna M Lal (36), Aadith J Krishna N (2), Ansaf Easa (23),
    and Muhammed Noufal (56) — driven by the common goal of solving real problems through technology. As active members
    of various college clubs and organizing committees, we often faced the hassle of booking venues, getting
    permissions,
    and coordinating events manually. This frustrating and time-consuming process inspired us to develop a centralized,
    fully digital event management system tailored for college campuses. Our project simplifies everything from hall
    booking
    to ticketing and permissions, helping both students and faculty save time and effort. Through this platform, we hope
    to
    make campus event organization more efficient, transparent, and stress-free.
